'''
An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called
Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 166)
or Exercise 9-5 (page 171). Add an attribute, privileges , that stores a list
of strings like "can add post" , "can delete post" , "can ban user" , and so on.
Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of
privileges. Create an instance of Admin , and call your method.

from user import User

class Privilege:
    '''
    9-8. Privileges: Write a separate Privileges class. The class should have one
    attribute, privileges , that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9-7.
    Move the show_privileges() method to this class. Make a Privileges instance
    as an attribute in the Admin class. Create a new instance of Admin and use your
    method to show its privileges.
